Welcome to my webspace. I am a postdoc researcher at MIT. I was born in Northeastern China, in a city called Shenyang. I came to the United States at the age of 19 and have studied and worked here for more than 15 years. I've lived and worked in Paris, France for 3 years. I am now living in Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA with my wife, a textile artist fom Mexico, and our son, who is 7 years old. My wife and I are makers in our hearts and soul. In addition to my research, I enjoy crafting, fixing, inventing and making strange things in our home studio and small machine shop.

# Research

I investigate life's origins and their records in the distant past and beyond our own planet amongst the stars. To do this, I take an environment-first and holistic approach to investivate life's origins. My primary toolkit to answer questions regarding early environment is via controlled experiments in the laboratory and in the field. By collecting rich environmental data from state-of-art sensors, and by modifying the environment and probing for responses, my research centers on resolving interactions between life and the environment, and track co-evolutionary relationships between the two.

My research is highly interdisciplinery and curiosity driven. It crosses academic disciplines such as Geology, Geochemistry, Geomicrobiology, Paleoentology, Ecology, Earth Evolution, Data Science and more. Here I state the high-level objectives while much more detailed descriptions for each project can be found in the [Projects](projects.html) page.

## Topic 1: Environments during the emergence of life on Earth and Astrobiology

My current research at MIT is motivated by my own analog experimental observations that fine-grained basalt-water interactions under a high pCO<sub>2</sub> anaerobic atomsphere at and below room-temperature condition are highly conductive to hydrogen gas production due to low redox potential. At the same time, an amorphous phase that resemble Fe-rich clay minerals were rapidly forming. At this low redox potential, it appears that organic synthesis is possible and can form a primitive carbon cycle. I am currently about the prospects of this research in astrobiology.

## Topic 1: Fossilization mechanisms

In nature, life's remains generally do not preserve for very long, rarely surpassing tens of thousands of years after death, because they are efficiently recycled by various processes. A very small fraction do preserve, in a format that what we call fossils which can last for millions of years or more. Our Earth is very old, formed some 4.6 billion years ago. The earlier back we examine in the rock record, the more difficult it is to find information about life. Still, life on Earth collectively left tracable records as far back as 3 billion years. In more then 80% of this history, the fossil record is dominated by tiny microorganisms while animals and plants are a rather recent phenomenon.

Fossil preservation depends on key transformations during which a more stable form of substance infiltrate, cast, stablize or replace the less stable original substance that life is made of. The presence of life may also induce environmental changes that are unique to the community's characteristics and behaviors. These traces can also be preserved. Despite decades of research, the mechanim of fossil formation remain illusive, partly because the long durations that might be required to form them.

My research focuses on (1) understanding the mechanisms of cellular degradation, and (2) probing environmental forces that drive stable mineral formation around cells, while linking this to life's core activities and metabolisms when the organism is alive, and when it is no longer alive while being degraded by other processes. This research can broadly guide us in the interpretation of fossil forms, and help us distinglish life from non-life forms in the rock record.

I take both laboratory experimental and field approaches to investigate the process of fossilization. Central to this research is to understand three kinds of common materials: amorphous silica, carbonate and silicate (clay) minerals that are very important at preserving morphological and chemical signatures of life. Instead of treating each mineral phases separately, I take an intergral approach realizing that prior to fossilization, the aqueous chemistry of metal cations and silicate, carbonate anions in solution play a crucial role. Therefore, I am heavily invested in efforts to develop efficient analytical and experimental tools that can help us track the solution chemistry during mineralization and fossilization. I hope to share in as much detail as I can how these tools are constructed and how experiments were conducted in the space of this website and in my publications.
