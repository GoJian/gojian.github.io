I am a research scientist at University of Wyoming, School of Computing. Here my mission is to promote computing in all fields of science, engineering, art and business. My job is to help accelerate your ideas and your research by employing state-of-the-art techniques and facilities. Please don't hestitate to reach out to me to discuss ideas and I will do my best to resolve any questions you may have.

I am trained as a geobiologist, astrobiologist and applied computational scientist interested in understaing the planet Earth as system and how various physical, chemical and biological processes are interlinked and coevolved together through deep time. Beyond Earth, I also investigate environmental evolution of other planets and their moons in the solar system. I work on NASA-sponsored projects such as life detection missions, environmental characterization and biosignature preservation, and topics related to the origin and nature of life.

My research interest is in complex system science, self-organization pattern formation theories, as well as modeling large and complex datasets to investigate causes and effects. I research answers to fundamental, bold questions such as: what is life, what is consciousness, what is the reality that we live in and how we arrived here. My main toolkits to resolve these questions are scientific experiments, organized datasets and advanced statistical modeling, deep-learning methods.
