Welcome to my website. I am now a postdoc researcher at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. I was born in Northeastern China, in a city called Shenyang. I came to the United States at the age of 19 and have studied and worked here for more than 15 years. I've lived and worked in Paris, France for 3 years. I am now living in Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA with my wife, whom I met in Mexico, and my son, who is 7  years old. My wife and I are makers in our heart, soul and by hands. In addition to my research, I am always crafting, fixing and making strange things in our home studio.

# Research

I investigate life's origins and their records in the deep distant past and beyond Earth amongst the stars. You may ask, "how do you do that?". Well, we start with what we know of the world around us. In the natural world, life's record generally do not preserve very long, not for tens of thousands of years or more, because they are efficiently recycled by various processes. Occasionally, they do preserve, in a format that what we call fossils. Our Earth is very old, some 4.6 billion years old. The earlier back we examine in the rock record, the less information and the more difficult it is to find about life. Still, life on Earth collectively formed a continuous record as far back as perhaps some 3.5 billion years ago. In more that 80% of this life's history, microorganisms dominated the record while animals and plants were a rather recent phenomenon.

## Research topic 1: Fossilization mechanisms

Because the preservation of fossils depend on the transformation that a more stable form of substance infiltrating, casting or replacing the original material substance that life is made of, it is rather critical that we understand how this process exactly happen. My research thus focuses on (1) understanding the mechanisms of cellular degradation, and (2) probing environmental forces that drive stable mineral formation around cells, while linking this to life's core activities and metabolisms when the organism is alive, and when it is no longer alive while being degraded by other processes. This research can broadly guide us in the interpretation of fossil forms, and help us distinglish life from non-life forms in the rock record.

I take both laboratory experimental and field approaches to investigate the process of fossilization. Central to this research is to understand three kinds of common materials: amorphous silica, carbonate and silicate (clay) minerals that are very important at preserving morphological and chemical signatures of life. Instead of treating each mineral phases separately, I take an intergral approach realizing that prior to fossilization, the aqueous chemistry of metal cations and silicate, carbonate anions in solution play a crucial role. Therefore, I am heavily invested in efforts to develop efficient analytical and experimental tools that can help us track the solution chemistry during mineralization and fossilization. I hope to share in as much detail as I can how these tools are constructed and how experiments were conducted in the space of this website and in my publications.

## Research topic 2: Environments during the origin of life

Help solving the mysteries regarding the origin of life is my life-long passion. My current investigation is motivated by experimental observations that fine-grained basalt-water interactions under a high pCO2 atomsphere are highly conductive to hydrogen gas production due to the low redox potential. At the same time, an amorphous phase that resemble Fe-rich clay minerals were rapidly being formed. At this low redox potential, it appears that organic synthesis is quite possible and can form a primitive carbon cycle. I am very excited about the prospects of this research in astrobiology.
