Welcome to my website.

# Who I am

I am now a postdoc researcher at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences. I was born in Northeastern China, in a city called Shenyang. I came to the United States at the age of 19 and have studied and worked here for more than 15 years. I've lived and worked in Paris, France for 3 years. I am now living in Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA with my wife, whom I met in Mexico, and my son, who is 7  years old. My wife and I are makers in our heart, soul and by hands. In addition to my research, I always found myself crafting, fixing and making things in our home studio.

# What I do

I investigate life's origins and records in the deep distant past as well as out there amongst the stars. You may ask, "how do you do that?". Well, let's start from the foundation -- it all started from simple observations. In the natural world, life's record do not preserve very long, not for tens of thousands of years or more, because they are efficiently recycled by various processes. Occationally, they do preserve, as what we call fossils. The Earth is very old, some 4.6 billion years old. The earlier back we go, the less records and information that we can find about life. However, as far as we know, life on Earth collectively formed a continuous record as far back as perhaps some 3.5 billion years ago. In more than 80% of the Earth's life history, the record of life are in the form of fossilized microorganisms.
